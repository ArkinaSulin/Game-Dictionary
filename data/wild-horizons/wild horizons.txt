Zara's back ground
Zara's Mother and Step-Father are Pale Elves/ Pallid Elves (also called Sunless Elves or sometimes Star Elves)
The Starsong Hills: The Fallen Star’s Rest
Despite their name, the Starsong Hills are no mere rolling highlands; they are a vast and ancient mountain range born from a celestial cataclysm. Eons ago, a great star fell from the heavens, crashing into the land with a force that reshaped the world. The impact raised jagged peaks, sundered the earth, and left behind veins of glowing quartz and celestial metals that still hum with otherworldly power.
Legends speak of the Starborne Flame, a lingering ember of the fallen star’s divine essence, said to still burn deep within the heart of the mountains. Some claim it grants visions, others whisper that it holds a forgotten god’s dying breath. Whatever the truth, its influence can be felt in the unnatural glow that shimmers across the peaks at night, casting eerie silver-blue light upon the land.
The mountains are treacherous and ever-changing, their paths obscured by shifting mists and magical anomalies left behind by the celestial event. Ancient ruins, some elven, some far older, dot the crags and valleys, remnants of civilizations that sought to claim the mountains’ power but ultimately vanished.
Deep beneath the shattered stone and celestial wreckage lies Sian’dorai, the hidden kingdom of the Pallid Elves. It is said that when the star fell, the ancestors of the elves took shelter in the caverns left behind, shaping them into the gleaming halls of their underground empire. They believe themselves to be the rightful heirs of the fallen star, their lineage tied to the divine flame that still flickers in the heart of the mountains.
Yet the Starsong Hills hold darker secrets as well. Strange creatures stalk the ruins, drawn to the lingering power of the fallen star. Whispers speak of deep places where reality frays, where forgotten entities stir, waiting for the right soul to call them forth.

Sian’Dorai
A Kingdom Beneath the Stars
Carved deep beneath the Starsong Hills, Sian’dorai is a kingdom of pallid elves who have dwelled under the mountains for thousands of years. The glowing quartz-and-crystal spires of their underground city reflect the pale light of enchanted braziers, creating an eternal twilight that mimics the starry sky. The city is a marvel of elven architecture and magic, blending seamlessly with the cavernous grandeur of the subterranean realm.

Zara's father, birth father, is obviously one of the mysteries for her but he is an entity of the 9 hells, which do have a gateway into Sian'Dorai

Arya's background
“Arya! Arya!”
Arya dropped the load of wood from his shoulders and looked up as his friend Iryna landed gracefully beside him, her transparent wings shimmering in the sunlight.

“What’s the matter?” he asked, brushing wood chips off his petal skirt.

Iryna flapped her wings excitedly and grabbed his arm. “Come quick! A young lad sealed a binding contract with Olena. The Elder is preparing her ceremony right now!”

Arya’s eyes widened. “Olena? But she’s only 35! A kid! How did this happen?”

Iryna leaned in, lowering her voice to a whisper. “I heard the lad used a straw she’d… well, used. To drink.”

Arya facepalmed. “Of course he did.”

The Nectar Hall was already buzzing with activity when they arrived. Fairies flitted about, filled the space with glittering fairy dust and decorating with garlands of glowing flowers. Arya couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy as he watched Olena, barely out of fairy adolescence, preparing for her binding ceremony.

Every year, the spring goddess Flora transformed her favorite flowers into fairies, sending them to different clans. Guardian fairies like Arya completed their studies by the age of 40 and were expected to form binding contracts with intelligent beings, usually energetic adventurers. In exchange for their magical assistance, fairies received a small amount of “stamina” from their charges, which they converted into fairy dust. This dust fueled their magic, including flight. While binding with a wizard yielded a greater return, such opportunities were rare for their scarce numbers.

The catch? To initiate a binding, the charge had to consume the fairy’s body fluid - completely unaware of the fairy’s presence. This randomness led fairies to believe that every binding was an act of fate.

For the past 60 years, Arya had dreamed of his own binding ceremony. But while he’d prepared and celebrated bindings for all his classmates - some multiple times - his own moment never came.

He couldn’t help but doubt himself:

Am I too heavy? He glanced at his muscular arms and the belly that blocked his view of his toes.

Are my wings too weak? His small, stubby wings could barely lift him five feet off the ground.

Am I too stupid? He struggled to remember even the simplest spell; just thinking about the “Sleep” spell made him yawn.

Every night, he lied to himself: Tomorrow. Tomorrow, someone will trip over my night soil, and it’ll finally happen.

He even tried to take matters into his own hands:

He splashed sweat into puddles, hoping someone would fall in and accidentally drink it. (No one did.)
He sneezed into empty cups at taverns, only for the waitress to wipe them clean before serving.
He even attempted to lick people in their dreams. (Given his agility, he quickly gave up.)

Unlike the delicate, agile fairies of legend, Arya was stocky and muscular, with wings too small for his frame. His unusual physique made him the village laughingstock and earned him a job as a lumberjack. While the work kept him busy, it did little to help his weight loss goals.

Over time, Arya came to accept himself. I may never bond with a wizard, he thought, and I may not look like a typical fairy, but without my wood, bakers couldn’t bake, and many fairies would freeze on winter nights. Almost everyone loves me! … except for a few jerks.

The First Encounter
One day, while chopping wood with his trusty axe, Winterchill, Arya noticed a band of travelers passing below. They paused, hearing the faint sound of his chopping, and looked up (DM please ask who will roll for perception.) Drop(s) of sweat fell from his brow, landing somewhere among them.

Did someone just consume my sweat? Arya wondered, his heart racing. He decided to follow them, his wings buzzing with anticipation.

Arya and money
Every morning, Arya would wake everybody up, whisper in their ears, collect their stamina/magic from his charge(s), converting it into fairy dust. He’d use some to sustain himself, some to enhance his collection of weapons and shield. (keeping them on par with his teammates) But most of the dust would be sent back to his clan via the wind.

Friends
Iryna,
Arya’s best friend, brought to life from a little white lily flower right next to himself, a big red Daylily. They were then sent to the same clan and always studied together. Although Iryna makes fun of Arya from time to time, she is also loyal to Arya as a friend.

Lunimaraevanthorion Draelonar Clan elder appointed by Flora
Meaning: “Radiant guardian of light and dreams, noble in magic.”
Pronunciation Guide:
Lunimaraevanthorion: Loo-nee-mah-RAY-van-THOR-ee-on
Draelonar: DRAY-lo-nar

He was a strong leader of the Guardian clan, promoting hard work, fair to all clan members. Your typical strong good leader. Arya is a bit scared of him, as he feels ashamed to disappoint him over and over again. The truth however, the elder never look down at him and try to encourage him every chance he has.

Arya, shed fairy dust in battle illuminating enermy making them much easier to hit. He also use Honeydrop (warhammer) to push enemy around battle field creating advantages positioning for his ally.



***Session 01:***
We start off during the Sunreach Midsummer Festival in Sunreach in Solvaris. Zara meets Arya when they introduce themselves as their new protector fairy, then they meet Fern when they are ordering snacks, Nira then comes up to us asking about a half-elven man named Rynn. Before the party can interact with Colm, an Ogre disrupts the festivities, as well some blighted vines. During the fight, we of course meet Colm, who has a bounty on him. Afterwards, the Ogre rots very fast, and the vines just go completely dead very quickly. We discuss some things a bit and then move on, when a gnomish woman approaches us and thanks us for helping with the attack, she asks us if we've seen anything like it before, which we haven't, although Nira knows it's not of this world (but is of the Material Plane). She asks us to meet us for dinner at her inn, the Gilded Ladle, where we could stay for free as long as the festival goes on, she introduces herself as Aunti Belba Mossfoot, and she's part of a merchant organisation that runs the city.
As we reach dinnertime ,we meet at the Gildel Ladle, and have dinner with Auntie Belba in a private room, and we learn that there have been some rumors about vines attacking carts heading into the city from the west. She then offers us a job investigating this further, we learn that Rynn that Nira is looking for has been last seen in Mistlake and that there's Myrtle in the swamp nearby that might know anything about Fern's walking tree, and she might know something about the Ogre too. If we do go there, stick to the paths, don't follow any lights that aren't lanterns, and ignore anyone whispering your name, and to take these tea leaves we get to her as well. We get offered the job at 200 gp total to go see Myrtle, but she might have more jobs for us in the future.

We get offered the job at 200 gp total to go see Myrtle, but she might have more jobs for us in the future.We then go and enjoy the festival, while Colm explaines the reason they have a bounty on their head, accused of poisoning their competition. We head into the festival, and end up getting drinks at a local tavern.


***Session 02:***
We start off in a tavern and discuss some things over drinks, and then head to bed in the Gilded Ladle. As we wake up, we are met by a note asking us to meet her in the private room for breakfast, and during this, we learn that there have been more attacks on caravans in the west, and people have gone missing, the councilmembers think there's nothing going on however, and it is suggested we ask Myrtle about this as well. We head towards the swamp where we find some Ogres, among them Rukk, looking for his brother Gurruk, the Ogre we killed, we tell them about our encounter, upon which they aks us to tell Gurruk's wife. After some discussion, we agree, and head on over the hill to their camp. We explain all that we know to Brakka, the wife, and while she is angry, although not at us, she reaffirms he was acting strange, and this isn't natural.Brakka's grandmother, Yarg, an Ogre wisewoman, says “A sickness born of night, but it don’t end there. Rot takes root in what’s weak. The fool fell first. He won’t be the last.” Further down to conversation, when we tell them we're heading to see Myrtle for more answers, and Yarg knows Myrtle, and tells us she doesn't personally trusts the way she practices druidism. As we leave, we are told we are always welcome here, for shelter, protection, or help.
We traverse the swamp to find Myrtle and her hut, we're invited inside for tea and start asking our questions. She tells us she's heard a few things from plants and animals, after sharing our information, we learn there's something funky going on between the Ogre's relationships, Brakka and Rukk seemed to be the match instead of Brakka and Gurruk. We also learn Billy, Fern's missing Treant, came her months ago because he heard whispers of this rot, he was going to talk to the trees in the east, and if they didn't know anything, he was going to head to Drak'Moru, a wilder region to the north-east
Ultimately, we are told she needs more evidence, perhaps following whispers and finding possesions from the missing people, and to steer clear from the center of the swamp, as it is both dangerous and sacred. Lastly, we are warned to watch out for a Lunar Widow's Bloom, a big glowing white flower, to bring her back one if we can, but it can attract things drawn to lunar energy to it. We follow the whispers, notably hearing "My reflection won't stop watching me" and "Don't folow the smell of flowers", before we  find a journal. As Colm touches it, we enter into combat with a Bloody Bones and three Bog Body's.
We defeat them, the Bog Body's seem like they have been here a while, though the Bloody Bones are very new, and the last entry of the journal says again "My reflection won't stop watching me" , which matches the reflection the Bloody Bones has. We found some potions of healing, and we close the journal, and only hear the flower one now. There's a broad discussion about sobriety and bloodlust, before we move on in the swamp.


***Session 03:***
We start off in the swamp, we travel north-west to follow the flower whispers, where we find a humanoid-ish alive-ish creature, it's lower half surrounded by black vines, and they beg us to "burn what remains", "keep the flower hidden", and "not look when the water reflects the stars". After we defeat them, we do burn it all, and we find a pack containing a sealed letter to this creature's daughter, a bunch of burned out candles, and a cracked "protective" charm. The flower whispers have now stopped as well.
As we head back to Myrtle's, the terrain seems to kind of change, but we manage to keep course, when we hear screaming in the distance. We manage to keep our course again heading towards the screaming. We find a hunting knife lodged in a tree, with the initials O.T carved in the handle, and boothprints surrounding it. As we continue, we see an Echo Wraith, trapped in a loop of it's last moments, a guy picking something up and then being dragged away by vines. As we defeat the wraith (with great great effort), and the scene fades, we see a Lunar Widow's Bloom in a clearing some distance away. We take a short rest while debating what to do with it, and then head up to the clearing.
There are some other wilting ones around the healthy one, as we approach the flower, a Moonshadow Beast appears out of the mist. Though Fern can't communicate with the creature, he can communicate with the flower, which encourages us to pluck it. After the defeat of the beast, we reconfirm that the flower wants to be plucked, and pluck it. We once again manage to find our way back to Myrtle, and we find ourselves in another clearing with a gnarled and pale, its bark gleaming fainly like moonlight. We take  a wide berth and move on, and through a wrong turn, find ourselves at Myrtle's hut. We do notice some Druidic signs made by Yarg, although they're almost like a different dialect from what Fern knows.
We ignore the sign and head in to the hut, giving her the flower and the information about what we encountered. She needs some time to find answers, so she suggests coming back tomorrow. So we head back to town to inform Auntie Belba of all that we have learned, she is intrigued by the Ogre soap opera, but she knows nothing about, and she does pay us our 200 gp. She also tells us she will reward us an additional 50 gp total for going back to Myrtle.We then take a long rest, and the next morning we head back to Myrtle's

***Session 04:***
We start off in Myrtle's hut ready for some answers, she tells us the rot is lunar in nature, not native to Aezmyr itself, but she thinks there are still more clues to be found out there. Zara returns to the party, telling Myrtle she has to tell us about her sister, "The Watcher of the Mire", whom she saw in the center of the swamp while chasing Luna, and a guy left an offering for her. She tells us after some presurring, that her sister was taken by a hag a long time ago, and that she was rescued, but she's in a kind of half-between state between her old self and her hag self, and for her and everyone else's safety she's kept there, and she hasn't found a cure for it yet. This might be tied to the rot, but she really doesn't know. To find more answers, she suggests going to the Sunken Verge, a part of the swamp that always feels damp, where the Echo Wraith's body might be, and she gives us a charm to find it. After some discussion about parentage and contracts, we start making our way there
When we arrive, we find an abandoned campsite, oddly organised, with signs of a struggle, and a piece of paper from a journal with “No stars here. The moon has eyes. Don’t dream on this soil.”. While we're looking for tracks, we're attacked by zombies and more vines. After we kill the zombies, the vine's wither and die, and we continue to look. We find a stachel containing a map tracking lunar fault lines, moon-touched sap, and a dream journal with the last scribbled note: “The vines are not of this world. They grow by moonlight, they feed on memory. I must go—I hear them calling her name
The charm continues to lead us into another clearing with lots and lots of candles and a dead body clutching a black candle. As Arya starts putting out candles, a hunched figure appears, a Waxling, and then a lot of Candlekin appear. After we defeat them we take a short rest, and we find some beeswax, strange herbs, some lunar stuff, a journal entry about voices offering clarity and a figure made of wax whispering to him, and one unfinished entry "She said I could light the way back to her. All I had to do was listen. The vines weren't cruel, just... hungry. I feel lighter now." We also learn the lunar fault lines seem to be in sinc with Nyx.
We head back to Sunreach to find Auntie Belba, and tell her basically that we are much more valuable than just as messengers between her and Myrtle. She tells us that one of the council members has also been acting strange since last morning. We discuss payment and expectations for a bit, and she asks us to check back in again tomorrow. We receive 100 gp total for our job and to enjoy the festival, where we end the session

***Session 05:***
We start off in Sunreach enjoying the festival, when we hear about a Midsummer Festival game involving mischief, and we are very quickly involved and recieve a list full of things we must achieve in return for potential prizes. First Fern wins the trust of the baby owlbear in the petting zoo, then Arya hits a bullseye on the magically shifting dartboard, and then Zara with the help of Colm captures the goose with the red ribbon. We then head to the Mischief Tent to verify we've d0ne these three things. Next up we head to the pie eating contest, and Arya gets a pie as spicy as dragonfire and manages to eat it without too much trouble.
Now we head to the bard on the main stage to make him laugh three times, Colm tries to intimidate him, and fails, then tries to attack him, and misses. Then Arya tells a joke and he laughs, Colm then tells a joke and attacks him at the same time, still making him laugh, and finally Fern tells a joke and he laughs for the third time. After that we head to the lost and found tent to find "The Egg", and choose the wooden egg painted like an easter egg. Next we head to the junk tent, where there's a lot of things that might be worth nothing or be supsiciously valuable, trading an expired goodberry for a family picture of a very big family.
Next up we find someone who refuses to part with their hat in order to obtain it, and Zara swipes it off of him, after some conversation, sharing of the pipe, and Redbeard doubling as a replacement hat for a while, we get back to the Mischief tent, when all hell breaks loose seeing as all the ducks and geese escaped. We enter a skill challenge to get them all back to their water fowl area in the lake, and together manage to do it, then we are left with the red ribboned goose, and we recapture it, Fern teleports in to grab it, Arya holds it's neck, Zara hold it's feet, and Colm distracts it for us to be able to completely hold it down.
Finally we once again return to the Mischief tent, where they are very impressed by all that we have done, and Auntie Belba herself hands us a gift basket and 50 gp for our winnings. As we continue enjoying the festival, we come across a bunch of job postings for adventurers as well. The one that stands out mentions a glowing stone that's dug up which mentions whispers, on the edge of Vaelzareth, then on the way to Drak'Moru, we could hit up a mission that mentions gatherers going missing in wildflower fields that are thicker than they should be, and then apart from Billy, in Drak'Moru, Bee Rexes were stolen in the night.
We go on our merry way, Zara being our sober party member from now, and then Fern enters a smoking figure contest, which he wins and gets a new magical pipe. Zara enters an archery competition and manages to land second place, winning a magical bowstring. Arya then enters a woodcutting competition, ending up in third place, winning a cute little kindling companion. Colm doesn't enter a competition, but a conversation ensues instead, and we learn that someone poisoned his weapon without his knowing for this murder he is wanted for.

***Session 06:***
We start off in Sunreach, Auntie Belba doesn't have anything for us to go for, so we start on our journey to Drak'Moru, stopping at Emberfell for the Mysterious Stone mission and Petalmere for the Thick Wildlower Fields mission. Rynn, the person that Nira is looking for who was last seen in Drak'Moru.
On the first day of travel we see a flock of translucent birds, and then an empty campsite with delicious smelling foreign food, Zara looks and finds no traps, but does find some footprints, and it looks like they just walked away. As we make camp, Fern's familiar the Twiddletoad is revealed, and we have a talk about darkvision-eye animals, pets, and domestication, before setting up a watch order, and as we sleep, Zara talks in her sleep with her slightly glowing and whispering bow. Apart from that, some different strange things happen during all of the four watches. We check upon the empty campsite, and strangely the food is still warm, but we decide to ignore it.
On our second day of travel, we come across some travelling tea merchants, and some of buy some magical tea's, and then we find a ruined waystation,  while there, we learn a lot about Zara, her mother and stepfather are the king and queen, both of which are elves, and Zara obviously is not, and her half-brother is the current regent, who send her away to "find someone more useful", while her parents are missing at the moment.  We also do find a magical coin that Zara takes that is also moon related, before we move on to  Emberfell.


As we arrive, we quickly see that Emberfell is an old town, not big, but the buildings look like they have been passed through the generations.  We go to the inn to get our rooms with the innkeeper, Bryn Ashwell, and get 3 rooms. Before that, we see bunch of kids around the "Singing Tree" daring each other to touch it, but after we secure the rooms, we go to check it out, and we discover signs of a hidden sinkhole. Fern talks to the tree, and it says to not go in, but Fern goes in, Arya's torch being in the way, and soon the party is down inside.

We start heading down, and enter into a mushroom cavern, which Fern harvests a bunch off, but there is also something down with us and combat ensues, as it does Fern seems to think we could have talked, but they were killed, and we find a moon-touched pendant. We also find some lunar runes on stones all around the cavern. We do however find some ancient carvings in the wall depicting a fallen star that becomes a seed. We go back up to the tree, it's still singing, and we take a long rest.

***Session 07:***
We start off in Emberfell, as we're long resting we have interesting dreams. Arya and Zara, dreamed of figures made of ash walkiing into dense fog, each one wearing different masks, Colm dreamed of sinking into silver dust soil, with something pulsing beneath them, not hustile, but hungry, and finally Fern dreamed of a sky cracked like glass, with a shard of a silver moon overhead, crying drops of liquid light that sizzle when they land, touching it doesn't cause pain, only sadness. Fern's dream is sort of discounted because of their substance use, and Nira doesn't share her dream. We have breakfast and talk a bit more about dreams, particularly about Zara's distrubing ones.
We then head towards Maeven's farm where the stone is, and meet Maeven Thornholt, and also learn that the sheep are just staring like they're listening to ghosts and that the crater just opened up one day. We head on over to the sheep, they are bleating and one is glowing faintly, Fern talks to the sheep and she says "She watches from the blue above. Her breath made the vines twitch. Not our pasture. Not anymore. Follow the soft earth. The cold thing hums there." The rest of them are kind of chanting "The moon is too close... too loud. We remember things we never lived. Roots hum beneath. You walk where others sleep." After some debate about the meaning of this, we head towards the stone next.
We start studying it and learn that it was at some point part of Nyx, and as we get even closer, a tunnel mysteriously opens and we head on down. As we head on in the first chamber, we find a shrine to something old, the vines somewhat resemble those that we fought, and learn that it's a celestial binding point where all three moons' influence intersect, something used for ancient magics, the lunar power it once held is now used for corruption. Then an Ashy Entity crawls out from behind it and starts attacking. After we defeat them, we find some gemstones , talk a bit about fire, and then move on and cut some vines.
We move on up and Arya touches the rock,and a mark briefly appears on their hand, and Arya also licks the rock and they sound funny for a bit, then Fern does the same thing with the same result. Colm tries to move the rock which is beachball size, but Arya ultimately is able to move it, and we roll it out of town to disperse any negative effects it had, completing our quest, and we head back to Maeve, who gives us a 100 gp, and tells us there is a lorekeeper in town. We get some more food and head towards Petalmere. And that is when Pep went to bed...

***Session 08:***
We start off after our long rest to continue our travel to Petalmere, halfway through the day we come across a glade with a a curious creature who greets us, and introduces himself as Chester, known by some as a whimsical inconvenience, and we're in "the Spirals". He'll show us something grand if we answer his three riddles, and if we fail we would be doomed to wander the Spirals forever.
"I'm not alive, but I can grow. I don't have lungs, but I need air. What am I?" Fire.
"I can be cracked, made, told, and played. What am I?" Joke.
"The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?" Footsteps.
Chester giggles and leads us out of a new opening, after about half an hour we come across another glade, where he wants us to do a spiral dance, where you move in a inward spiral while reciting a riddle. We do so and another path opens, and he gives us a silver coin that reveals hidden paths in the moonlight. Before we leave he tells us after two more games he'll show us something bigger.  Once we get out of the Spirals, we arrive just on the outside of Petalmere, saving us two days of travel.
As we arrive, we ask where the Elder's Circle is, and are directed to Elder Myla's cottage. A human girl, named Tamson, went out into the flower field to go picking and never got out, and that this place is connected to the Feywild, although it's not supposed to be active right now and not this strongly. We also learn that Tamson has a special connection with the flowers. The settler's here made a bargain with the Ash Thorn Court, in return for protection and bounty, the village maintained a Bloom-Keeper, Myla's grandmother was the last one, and the rites were lost upon her death
We head into the wildflower fields, and while we're searching a Thorn Sprite appears and tells us if we want to talk to her majesty, we need to perform the proper ritual involving a stone circle, lanterns, petals, and a rhyme. We envoke an audience with her, explaining that the townspeople forgot the rites that were part of their bargain. In turn we are told that every generation one person from the bloodline is taken according to the deal, and that a replacement would need to be found, they're not killed though, just taken.
We accept her invitation to see for ourselves and enter the Feywild, in an impossibly beautiful glade. Tamson loves it here, and definitely doesn't want to go home. The party leaves the Feywild, Fern reluctantly, with a scroll in tow detailing the bargain made long ago. We return to Myla with both the testimonial from Tamson and apparently Myla's sister as well as the scroll, and although reluctantly, Myla does seem to see the wisdom in the bargain and in our handling in the situation, and rewards us with 200 gp each, as well as free lodging and meals for a week should we choose to stay.
We decide to at least stick around for today and see what other stuff is going in town, at the tavern/inn we hear about wishes coming true not in the way that ttey want through the wishing well, and the herb shop and apothecary are blaming eachother for tainted herbs, a feud that's been going on for a while. We head on over to the well, finding spiral runes, with fey bound magic bound to "Drowzel the Moon Bog Nixie", and the runes say to toss a silver coing into the well and whispering "Drowzel Keeper of Wishes", to make her appear. Zara does so and she appears, asking how she can help Zara, to help her by not making a wish, she asks for a serious secret.
After some discussion, Fern wishes to know where Billy is right now, learning “Not here… not there… they tread where whispers walk and shadows dance. A place forgotten but not lost… where the petals touch but do not bloom. They move, yes… but not alone. Shadows follow. Eyes watch. I would hurry, if I were you.”
Zara wishes to know the identity of her father, learning "Your father walks the petals, child. A wanderer of the bloom. But he’s not alone… oh no. He belongs to the roots now. Did you think you were the only one with a taste of the wild? Seek him where the flowers grow tall and the whispers are louder. He is part of it now… just like the others.” After seeing his figure, vines around his feet, eyes an unnatural silver, petals blooming around his fingertips.

Nira wishes to know what her friend Rynn's big thing was caught up in, seeing a jungle-like landscapek, with Bee Rexes, Rynn excited and being well dressed in explorer's gear. And then hearing “There he is, darling! Dancing with dinosaurs, prancing with pollen. He’s deep in Drak'Moru, you see… living among the wilds with those buzzing beasts. He found what he was looking for. Now let’s hope it doesn’t find him first.”
Colm wishes to know about who poisened his blade unknowingly, seeing two figures, one hooded and the other an armorer from the tournament, the hooded one being a noble and instructing and buying the armorer off to put the poison on the blade. Then hearing “Greed and favor, iron and shame. They paid well for that little touch of death… but it wasn’t their first time, oh no. The one you seek is called Varyn Crowsblood… and they’re not done yet.” With all that new information in mind, we end the session, planning to head over to Drak'Moru as soon as possible.

***Session 10:***
We start off in Mudwater Bend, talking to Mawmaw Roux, "everybody's" grandma, who tells us that Billy, the Treant Fern is looking for came here, and they put him into the sort of inn called the Hollow Spire, but he didn't come out the following morning, which has never happened before, and is nowhere to be found. Joonie pipes up and tells us that something is definitely off with the tree, and that it feels like it's alive again. Fern describes Billy as well as his relationship with him and his family that is now scattered and all over the place. Without futher ado, we head into the Spire.
As we head in, we see a liveable place, as well as the one bark figure looking like each of us to us individually. It seems to study us, but we can't get any reaction out of it. We decide to leave it for now and head into the next room where we each hear something different, but with nothing inside the room except a door leading to the next chamber. Inside the next room is Billy rooted with pulsing light mimicking our heartbeat, he tells us that the Spire told us that it's been alone for too long, that he knew Fern would come, and that it needs a purpose. During the discussion about what to do with it, Billy as the speaker for the tree,we learn that Drak'Moru is special, and the land is alive, the tree wasn't dead, it was dormant. The whispering we heard in the previous room seems to be something related to something we feel or think deep down. More discussion later, and we agree that at the very least we can do a trial period.
After telling the tree that we want to give it a try, we learn that the inside of the tree is like an extra dimensional space, and that it can change according to our needs, basically, we got our Bastion (when we reach level 5)! Everybody then kind of does their own thing, Fern and Billy catch up, Billy heard the message from the tree through the root network, which is new to him too, and he did leave a message saying he would be right back, but it wasn't "well placed", it seems after Billy is done being the voice of the tree he would go exploring the world, and Fern likewise would do the same, trying to find all that set out to find Billy in the meantime and sending them home. Having had some rest, we now decide to go and deal with the town's Bullywug problem at the Hollow Pools.
Before we actually head off, we learn of a mising goat and a wolf's howl, which Joonie tells is not a wolf or werewolf, but instead the Rougarou, some kind of wolf hybrid. Arriving we are halted by Bullywugs, their leader is Sage Splup the Slime, and they claim this as their land. We kill them, although it takes longer than we wish to admit. The blood manages to attract the Rougarou, or the Gatorougarou, whom we kill as well, with once again more effort than we would like to admit. We have a small discussion about bloodthirst before we head back into town having dealt with the Bullywug problem. Mawmaw Roux rewards us for dealing with both the Bullywugs and the Gatorougarou. Next time we might be headed for the supply transport mission as well as the Bee Rexes, but for now we are level 5

As we head back into town, a figure appears from behind some bushes, and it's a cute dog dropping a small piece of bark with a rune on it. As we head back into the spire from Billy we learn that this is the moss key, and that it's tied to the Spire, and it functions as a way to get to the Bastion and back once per week. The dog Barkle, who brought the key to us, can bring messages and small items from us to the Bastion and vice versa.

***Session 11:***
We start off heading towards the brewmaster Brack, who needs a shipment out to the Wildrunners, the Halfling clans further inland that take care of the Bee Rexes. The initial offer is 75 gp to take one barrel there, but Nira manages to get it up to 100 gp and a bag of holding. We need to drop it at the outpost, not shake it, and ignore it if it sings... We then head to the market to sell the stuff, and buy a few items. We then take a long rest while starting working on getting the special facilities up and running.
The next morning we head on out towards the outpostwhen we are blocked by a river, which we cleverly bypass, some more creatively than others. Everyone contributing we succeed on keeping on our way to the outpost, and around midday, we find ourselves surrounded by Raptors. One of the raptors gets sucked into the ground by fiery chains, the one who got hit by Zara's Hellish Rebuke, so a conversation ensues about Zara's bow and this sort of mysterious patron that tells her she's special and destined for greater things. We move on and again we all make sure we find a decent camping spot, and we end the session with a long rest.

***Session 12:***
We start off journeying further towards the Wildrunner clan, when we come across a split in the road, either a ridgeline pass, or thick brush. We choose to go through the brush, and quickly come across a small clearing with a pond, as well as some more Raptors. After the fight we take a short rest, Fern harvests some meat from the non-explosive kind, and we move on. Nothing exciting happens, so we take a long rest, some of us enjoying some Raptor stew, and the following morning, Raptor bacon. We come across another split in the road, the left looking potentially dangerous because of natural things, the right because of unnatural things, so we take the left path, and come across some mist, mushrooms (not the fun kind), and a low growling from the brush.Moving on, there's signs of more raptors, and as Colm becomes large, Fern adds an Enlarge as well, and huge Colm succesfully intimidates some Raptors, but it doesn't necessarily pan out like we wanted it, facing some Stormseed Broodlings as well. Again after combat and an Aura of Vitality, we decide to take another short rest.

***Session 13:***

***Session 14:***
We start off in the larger Wildrunner outposts, we're about to take a long rest when we are requested to talk to the elder in the morning, which we do. We meet up with Branver Emberbrush, he tells us that food and tools get moved, and if this is Leshy (plant people) mischief, that we deal with it quietly and peacefully, and head down the ravine trail to see who's behind it. We agree and follow the path,  finding some Leshy, who ask us if we felt the hum, and tells us they used the piles of food and tools to ward off something that's changing and to warn, leaving behind rare herbs in return. We ask about the change and learn that something from the moon broke off (which sounds familiar) very long ago, the Queen of the Bee Rexes had to leave and now the hive is quiet.
More enigmatic things were said, but it seems to boil down to the moon rot problem we're familiar with, and even creatures in the Underdark fear it. Before we leave to report back Murmura (the Leshy) gives us a pouch of medicinal herbs. We report back, and do learn that in their earlier history, during their nomadic days, they did have to move the Bee Rexes from their usual spot. For rescueing the baby Bee Rex, we get some bee balm poultice and then get directions to their main settlement, which is where we head next.
We find and fight some Raptors of course, Arya harvesting some meat, and we arrive at Snagroot Village, the main settlement of the Bee Rex herders. We arrive and settle down in our quarters, while Fern serves a fruit and nut platter for starters, and then starts cooking Raptor stew and honey backed Raptor ham, Arya being so annoying it breaks Fern's very chill vibe. After dinner we go to the hivekeeper to see if we can find/buy some Bee Rex honey, which we get for free.
As we pass another Swiftclaw pen, we see a Wildrunner wrangler as well as Rynn, Nira's missing friend. Nira explained to him that after his vague letter she spend lots of time, and most if not all of her money to follow him, while also worrying about him. He told her that he went on a sideways adventure involving the Bee Rexes, and got stranded here, encountered some frog-like creature, and made it back here, where he's been for two weeks now. The party discusses mating rituals and such while Rynn and Nira  seem to get away, and we take a long rest.

***Session 15:***
We start off in Snagroot Village, heading towards the elders to talk with them first thing in the morning, there's a group of fire loving kobolds out there, Emberfangs, who are raiding and bothering the tribe, and we are asked to deal with them, and we do have a general direction to go to thanks to Rynn. As thanks for what we have already done, as well as what we're about to do, we each get a personal reward.We head out and follow the right trail, as we get closer, we get ambushed by some Kobolds. After the scuffle, with a much needed pass without a trace, we sneak up on the encampment with more Kobolds and a Half-red Dragon Allosaurus, as well as an adolescent Bee-Rex in a cage.
We fight and kill them, and deduce the ritual was some kind of sacrifice to the Allosaurus, nonmagical, and find a map with two other poaching path and a larger operation deeper in the jungle named "The Nest", as well as some coinage and a Pyromancer's Bottle. We free the Bee-Rex and then head back towards Snagroot Village. We decide to hit the other two outposts before hitting the big one and we level up!
***Session 16:***
We start off back in Snagroot Village and take a long rest, the next morning we head out with some Wildrunners to take care of the Emberfang outposts and then their main camp, the Wildrunners accompany us to take care of any Bee-Rexes we free. We arrive at the first and closest outpost, which is empty and quiet, save for the corpses of Kobolds, presumably from infighting. We find some tracks leading into the nearby caves, follow them and face some more Kobolds. We kill them and Zara, unsatisfied with consuming her bloodlust kills some mushrooms and tries to kill a nonexistent fish. We go to a different section of the cave, finding and killing a Red Slaad and a couple of Slaad Tadpoles.
We venture forth and find a Slaad Broodmaster and another Red Slaad for our troubles. Having cleared the caves and the camp, and finding some interesting stuff, we decide to take a short rest before moving on towards the next outpost.
***Session 17:***
We start off heading towards the next outpost, which is where we arrive at the end of the day. The camp seems weirdly empty, but we quickly spot a hole which seems to be caused by some creature burrowing, and we hear a screech coming from below. As we explore one of the buildings, two Tunnel Howlers emerge, and 4 more during the course of the fight. We then move down into the tunnels, where we find some more Tunnel Howlers, and press on further, where we find two different bigger ones.
Confident that we cleared the place, we leave the tunnels and go investigate the rest of these buildings,  finding some magical items and money, and take a long rest. The next morning, as we head to the main encampment, we find a rockslide blocking our way, although there is a tunnel that will get us to it the longer way.

***Session 18:***
We start off in the tunnel system trying to get to the other side, which we do find, but due to Arya's mushroom licking, we move cautiously, trying to make sure we don't get enveloped in mist. Inside we find a carved hole leading down as well as a kobold corpse with a scrap of parchment, which seems to be from the third outpost saying to run. When we enter the room however, we get roped into combat with a Roper. We move back to the hole, collect the treasure, and then we move on our way towards the main encampment of the Emberfangs.
We enter "The Nest", another underground lair, with lots of caves. We move down, using the big tunnel instead of the two small tunnels. We move down a door and fine some Wildrunners impisoned, which we free, they advise us against the way we are going, but we ignore them and tell them to go back to their clan while we go on. We go on, and find the half Red-Dragon Indominus Rex, which maybe gives us some regrets for moving this way.After the fight, Zara and Fern take some time healing the party. And them we head in further, and we find some trouble...

After the fight, Zara and Fern take some time healing the party. And them we head in further, and we find some trouble...
We move on and head towards the second level of the prison, where we find even more kobolds, whom we defeat, and we also head down the other two tunnels, where we kill some more kobolds, free some Wildrunners, and find some more innocent young Bee-Rexes. After "The Nest"has been cleared, we head out and a stampede of different animals assualts Fern, Fern's family, who have been in search of Billy, finally found Fern, and after explaining that Billy's on his own path, the family will be heading back with Fern to guide them, and Fern to see to his own forest now. Goodbyes are had, tears are shed, and a very fine parting the party has.

***Session 19:***
We start off in "The Nest", taking a short rest, and finding some gems as well as a wanted poster of Colm. We move down to the south, where we find some more kobolds. After we defeat them, we find some useful magical items, and use an Aura of Vitality to heal the party up before moving on. We find an armory, the first layer being useless, the second layer being much much better, and the third layer layer ends up being a barracks, and we kill every kobold in sigh

Session 27

After a well-earned long rest, our party awakened with renewed strength, having advanced to level 7. We departed Thornscar Hold behind us, setting out along a trail that felt distinctly different from the wild paths we'd traveled before—this one was straighter, broader, and clearly maintained with machetes and heavy boots. Though the jungle still pressed in on both sides, alive with birdcalls and shadows, for the first time in days we walked a road with clear intention. Our destination was Stonehaven Shores, though the untamed landscape reminded us that civilization remained merely a promise, not yet a comfort.
Midway through our journey, the trail divided around a moss-crusted boulder shaped like a jagged fang. With both routes showing signs of use but locals disagreeing about which was better, we chose the left path that wound over a ridge. This decision soon led us into confrontation with massive anacondas lurking in the jungle growth. After dispatching the serpents, Zara took the opportunity to examine their remains closely, slitting open a snake's belly and rubbing the blood on her hands. This sparked a philosophical discussion about whether snakes possess souls, with Brynd wondering aloud if goblins had souls either. The conversation turned to what threshold of intelligence might be required for soulhood, prompting Brynd to declare a personal quest to find a necromancer who could answer how stupid one must be to lack a soul. In a characteristically reckless move, Brynd decided to build resistance to snake venom by swallowing a few drops of poison, despite everyone's protests. The result was predictable yet dramatic—foaming at the mouth and violent illness, though he managed to summon enough ki energy to heal himself partially.
Continuing our journey, we encountered another obstacle: a family of broad-shelled, long-necked dinosaurs lounging across the sunny path. Choosing stealth over confrontation, we successfully sneaked past them with only one minor stumble.
By late afternoon, the jungle began to thin, replaced by salt-scented palms as the distant boom of waves carried inland. The trail widened into a proper road bearing the marks of steady traffic, leading us to Stonehaven Shores. The town proved to be predominantly populated by elderly goliaths, giving it the atmosphere of a retirement community. Concern immediately arose about Colm's bounty poster having been issued from this very town, with Zara and Brynd suggesting disguises to avoid recognition. Colm, however, walked forward with characteristic pride and indifference, while Zara offered to eliminate anyone who threatened him — an offer Colm pointedly ignored by looking away from her.
Arya felt immediate relaxation upon reaching civilization and developed a powerful thirst for alcohol, which Zara accommodated by providing coins for drinks. The entire town moved at a leisurely pace, confirming its reputation as a goliath retirement haven. Our purpose here was to investigate why Colm's bounty originated so far from where the assassination had occurred, with Colm seeking connections between this place and his homeland, particularly any personal links back to the king.
We found out the village leader is Valdrek Tidewatcher. Instead we visited the record keeper Elder Marrin Broadshoulder, who explained that they maintain archives containing records plus file from all retired record keepers. She revealed there were conflicting reports about what actually happened at the tournament, causing the warrant to be placed on hold. Most intriguingly, she confirmed that Tyber — the man Colm was accused of poisoning — had been sighted in multiple locations near Itinit after the tournament.
record keeper show the following record
"Partial Contents

Page 15 – The Final Match
“Combat commenced under ceremonial watch. Audience in full attendance. At the second exchange, the heir fell to one knee, clutching his chest. No visible wound beyond a single nick to the side. Physician’s record: tissue blackened within moments.
Ursor’s halberd examined and found coated with a viscous residue of unknown make.
Judgment: deliberate poisoning.”
(A faint smear near “unknown make” gleams green-gray under torchlight — an alchemical sheen invisible in the cold north but reactive in humid air.)
Margin Note (faint, opposite side):
“Residue identical to sample confiscated from royal stores two nights prior — labeled ‘venin distillate – ceremonial use only.’”
(Initialed: G. S.)
Page 19 – Royal Verdict
Final Decree
“Condemned: Colm Ursor, for unlawful use of toxin and fatal breach of royal conduct. Sentence: death by exile or execution upon return.”
Beneath the decree, in smaller hand:
“Entry amended at royal order. Original scribe struck from record.”
The records themselves told a compelling story. Page 15 described the final match where the heir fell to one knee clutching his chest, with physicians noting his tissue blackened instantly. Colm's halberd was found coated with a viscous residue, leading to a judgment of deliberate poisoning. A critical margin note, however, revealed the residue matched samples confiscated from royal stores two nights earlier, labeled "venin distillate – ceremonial use only." Most damning of all was the note that the entry had been amended at royal order, with the original scribe struck from record.
Colm described a recurring dream featuring a "silver and blue banner with an emblazoned crown and twisting vine, hanging from a ruined watchtower half-buried in snow with a hooded figure standing beside it." The record keeper didn't recognize this symbol but agreed to inquire about it. As we pieced together information, Colm realized that if the poison wasn't meant for Tyber, then Noa the grand daughter of the former king of Itinit, King Yout, might be the actual target.
The record keeper admitted her own confusion about the situation, noting the logistics of transporting Colm to Itinit would cost more than the bounty offered. Colm declared his determination to find who set him up and exact revenge, though he continued to avoid eye contact with Zara throughout the conversation so she does not start a massacre.
When asked about unusual plants causing trouble, the record keeper had no specific records but had heard rumors. She mentioned several local events we could investigate: 
- the Stoneball Classic tournament, 
- a storyteller who wandered off and never returned, 
- a crypt uncovered by violent tides that someone had poked at but not properly explored, and
- retired wrestling champions who had started an open brawl.
Zara thanked the record keepers while casually mentioning she'd have no problem killing them if they tried to take Colm. She also secured confirmation from the record keeper that snakes do indeed have souls, triumphantly informing Brynd that her position had been validated by an scholar.
With travel north to Frosthallow to save Noa not feeling immediately urgent, the party decided to remain in Stonehaven Shores for a few days. On the way north to Itinit the party would pass by the land of Zepharok, where  the party could test our skills in the arena. Arya is growing bored with all the conversation, he bought everyone drinks, though Zara got herself a virgin daiquiri instead.
The party decide to take on the first event to investigate. The party gathered at where Tom Bouldertstep's walking stick (an item he never parted with) washed up on shore. Arya walked into the sea, watching the waves erase his footprints, he immediately declear they could officially strike his name from the town records now. The situation took an odd turn when Tom returned to town a few days later, found naked and confused.
With multiple options before us, we settled on investigating the crypt that had been uncovered by the violent tides. At least, as someone noted, it wouldn't move away from us.

Session 28

The party made their way to the crypt by the bay, where the sea lapped quietly against the sand and the wind carried the scent of salt and old stone. Near the entrance, shapes shifted in the gloom — a cluster of undead, half-buried in seaweed and sand. One stood taller than the rest, its form strangely reflective, pale like moonlit skin. Zara and Azren exchanged a look; it resembled other moon-touched creatures they had encountered before, though not of Luna’s blood. Perhaps this, too, was another symptom of the irregular lunar influence spreading across the land.
The battle began in an instant. The old corpse struck Bryan with crushing force, nearly killing him. Before it could land another blow, Azren stepped forward, calm and steady, divine light flaring around his hand. He drew a dart, whispered a prayer, and hurled it with precision — the projectile streaked through the air like a falling star. When it hit, a surge of radiant energy burst outward, lighting the crypt in silver flame. The undead’s flesh blistered and cracked, the light pouring from its eyes and mouth before it disintegrated to dust, carried off by the sea breeze. The others, suddenly leaderless, fell easily after that.
On the bodies, the party found a Ring of Water Walking and several relics stolen from the tomb — grim proof that these undead were once thieves who disturbed the dead. Azren suggested they return the remains to rest, and Arya, once a lumberjack fairy and never shy of hard work, took the lead in carrying and digging. He wove together a makeshift stretcher from coconut leaves and hauled the remains back into the crypt.
With the duty done, the group lingered by the shore. Colm, stretching his shoulders, suggested that everyone join him in lifting his halberd 1,700 times. The others laughed and declined, leaving him to his self-imposed workout while they rested and watched the light fade across the water.
That evening, they went searching for a retired wrestling champion to spar with, but the old man was long past his prime. Instead, they entered the Stoneball Classic, a local tournament that mixed strength and agility. The first round tested muscle, the second speed, and the third end up to be a complete mayhem. A dinosaur crashed onto the field mid-match, and in the scramble to contain it, Zara, Azren, and Arya all slipped in a pile of barf, earning roars of laughter from the crowd. Despite the ridiculous turn of events, the group managed to win, pocketing 15 gold pieces and a few bruised egos.
As the moon rose over the bay, silver and strange, the party made plans to head north through the desert of Zepharok, bound for the Colosseum before heading to Itinit.
